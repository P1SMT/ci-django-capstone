File included to document that have been able to reset Gitpod files to previous commit of 5b32f55dabcac306c99843863860e93ec7272fcb, then intend to try
and add django app again this time with name in lowercase and see if that solves issue that arose.
In doing the above I used the 'git push --force' command and found that that erased all commit history of problem that previously occured when 
using django create app functionality

Success - been able to create an app named 'weather' in this django project, out of sequence of instructions given by Code Institute, that operation
failed the first time, which currently can only attribute to having used ALL CAPS as the name format of the app first time around

creation of django superuser - details saved on iphone

NB: I googled how to reset the head of main branch to an eariler commit whilst still maintaining all the history in the github repository "git push --force origin main"
was given as the command that would do that. It didn't. It earased 11 commits from the main branch history. It has return me to the point in code I wished to be
but any evidence of several days work (that did not prove fruitful) has now been erased.
