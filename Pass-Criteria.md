# Project Submission Criteria

## Pass Criteria

All Pass criteria must be achieved for a pass to be awarded. It is expected that project work submitted for this unit will demonstrate the same knowledge and skills shown in HTML/CSS/JavaScript/Python Essentials modules across the grading levels.

To achieve these criteria it is a good idea to keep the following aspects in mind when creating your project.

## Project Requirements

- The learner has a clear rationale for the development of this project and has produced a fully functioning, well-documented, relational database-backed, Full-Stack application for a real-life audience, with a complete set of CRUD (creation, reading, updating and deletion of data records) features.
- Data validation, API handling and user feedback are all evident in the code and the working application. Templates are used to produce working features correctly.
- There are no logic errors in the code, and the application functions as expected.
- The finished project has a clear, well-defined purpose addressing the needs of a particular target audience (or multiple related audiences) and a particular data domain.
- Its purpose would be immediately evident to a new user without having to look at supporting documentation.
- The user is kept informed of progress and actions through feedback and, where large data sets are being loaded, progress indicators.
- The web application design follows the principles of UX design and accessibility guidelines, and the site is fully responsive.
- Data is fully modelled and matches the schema. The schema design is documented in the README.
- The datastore configuration is kept in a single location and can be changed easily. Configuration and settings files are well-organised, and there are different versions for different branches.
- The learner has documented a clear, justified rationale for a real-world application. The project's development has resulted in a fully-functioning, interactive web application.
- The finished project is judged to be publishable in its current form with an evidenced professional-grade user interface and interaction adhering to current practice.
- There are no logic errors in the code.
- Where there is a clear breach of accepted design/UX principles or accepted good practice in code organisation, these are fully justified, appropriate and acceptable to the target user.
- It matches the design and demonstrates the characteristics of craftsmanship in the code. The resulting application is original and not a copy of any walkthrough projects encountered in the unit.

## Front-End Design

The design of the web application demonstrates the main principles of good UX design:

### Information Hierarchy

- Semantic markup is used to convey structure - all information displayed on the site is presented in an organised fashion with each piece of information being easy to find.
- All information displayed on the site is presented in an organised fashion with each piece of information being easy to find.
- All resources on the site are easy to find, allowing users to navigate the layout of the site intuitively.
- Information is presented and categorised in terms of its priority.

### User Control

- All interaction with the site would likely produce a positive emotional response in the user. This response is down to the flow of information layout, use of colour, clear and unambiguous navigation structures and all interaction feedback.
- When displaying media files, the site avoids aggressive automatic pop-ups and autoplay of audio, instead letting the user initiate and control such actions.
- Users who direct to a non-existent page or resource are redirected back to the main page without using the browser navigation buttons.
- Users are never asked for information that the application already has (e.g. a contact form does not ask a logged-in user for an email address).
- The user is shown progress indicators and feedback on transactions.
- Errors resulting from user or data actions are reported to the user.

### Consistency

- Evident across all pages/sections and covers interactivity as well as design.
- Consistency across all data operations, including in the reporting.

### Confirmation

- User and data actions are confirmed where appropriate, feedback is given at all times.

### Accessibility

- There is clear conformity to accessibility guidelines across all pages/sections and in all interactivity.
- Any design decisions that contravene accepted user interaction, user experience design principles are identified and described (comments in code and/or a section in the README).

## Development and Implementation

### Code demonstrates characteristics of ‘clean code’

- Consistent and appropriate naming conventions within code and in file naming, e.g.
  - File names, class names, function names and variable names are descriptive and consistent.
  - For cross-platform compatibility, file and directory names will not have spaces in them and will be lower-case only.
  - All HTML attributes, CSS rules, code variables and function names are consistent in format, follow standards for the language and are appropriate and meaningful.
  - App URLs are consistent.

### File structure

- Whenever relevant, files are grouped in directories by file type (e.g. an assets directory will contain all static files, and code may be organised into sub-directories such as css, js, etc).
- There is a clear separation between custom code and any external files (for example, library files are all inside a directory named 'libraries').
- Files are named consistently and descriptively, without spaces or capitalisation to allow for cross-platform compatibility.

### Readability

- Code is indented consistently to ease readability, and there are no unnecessary repeated blank lines (and never more than 2).
- ID/class (CSS and JavaScript)/function/variable names clearly indicate their purpose.
- All code is split into well-defined and commented sections.
- Semantic markup is used to structure HTML code.
- HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python are kept in separate, linked files.
- CSS files are linked to in the HTML file’s head element.
- Non-trivial Javascript code files are linked to at the bottom of the body element (or bottom of the head element if needs loaded before the body HTML).

### Defensive design

- All input data is validated (e.g. presence check, format check, range check).
- Internal errors are handled gracefully and users are notified of the problem where appropriate.

### Comments

- All custom code files include clear and relevant comments explaining the purpose of code segments.

### Compliant code

- HTML code passes through the official W3C validator with no issues.
- CSS code passes through the official (Jigsaw) validator with no issues.
- JavaScript code passes through a linter (e.g. jslint.com) with no major issues.
- Python code is consistent in style and conforms to the PEP8 style guide (or another explicitly mentioned style guide, such as Google's).

### Robust code

- No logic errors are found when running code.
- Errors caused by user actions are handled.
- Where used, API calls that fail to execute or return data will be handled gracefully, with the site users notified in an obvious way.
- Inputs are validated when necessary.
- Navigating between pages via the back/forward buttons can never break the site, there are no broken links.
- User actions do not cause internal errors on the page or in the console.
- The entire design is implemented, providing an excellent solution to the users' demands and expectations and security consideration.

## Real-world application

- Understandable site-specific content is used rather than Lorem Ipsum placeholder text.
- All links to external pages open in a separate tab when clicked.
- The final application is aligned to the user stories presented at the start of the project.
- Testing procedures are comprehensive, with a good level of coverage, and have been followed. All noticeable errors have been corrected or documented:
  - Security features and practice are evidenced.
  - Passwords and secret keys are stored in environment variables or in files that are in .gitignore and are never committed to the repository.
  - Any functionality requiring log-in is available only to logged-in users.
  - User permissions and levels of access are appropriate.
  - Framework conventions are followed, and used correctly. Including the following:

### Django

- Templates
- Apps
- Models
- Views
- Placing logic in the most relevant components demonstrates an understanding of the Model-View-Controller (Template) pattern is evident through the placing of logic in the most appropriate components.
- Configuration and settings files are well-organised.
- Data is well structured.
- Data is fully modelled and matches the schema.
- Datastore configuration is kept in a single location where it can be changed easily.
- Data is well-structured, and organised into logical entities with clear relationships between them.
- All CRUD functionality is present and working, and actions are immediately reflected in the Front-End.
- Any data used across multiple apps is shared and not duplicated.
- Configuration and dependencies files are kept up to date. Separate versions/branches of these are commits where relevant.
- The datastore configuration is kept in a single location and can be changed easily. The datastore is not accessible to the regular user without going through the code.
- Testing procedures are comprehensive, with a good level of coverage, and have clearly been followed. There is clear evidence of testing, and this is demonstrated in git commits. All noticeable errors have been corrected or documented:
  - Navigating between pages via the back/forward buttons can never break the site, there are no broken links.
  - User actions do not cause internal errors on the page or in the console.

## README

### Recommended structure for a README.md file

As a mandatory part of the submission, your project must have a readme file named README.md, in markdown format, that will describe all aspects of your project.

The link below provides an official example of an expected structure for your readme file:

[Example README.md template](#)

### NOTE:

While it is a requirement for your README to be in English, we also strongly recommend that your site is in English too. The assessment will be conducted in English, so to ensure that the functionality and navigation can be fully assessed, we recommend that the site is in English. If the site is in a language other

## Plagiarism

Plagiarism, as defined by the Oxford dictionary, is “the practice of taking someone else's work or ideas and passing them off as one's own.” It is a serious academic offence for which there are serious consequences.

It is acceptable to use and reference others’ code. However, it is an academic plagiarism offence if any piece of work which is not entirely the student’s own is not correctly referenced or acknowledged. All student projects submitted will be reviewed for plagiarism. This review includes checking code comparison tools, plagiarism software, review of git commit history and other mechanisms.

It is the student's responsibility to ensure that any direct or indirect inclusion of the work of others is fully and adequately acknowledged. We appreciate that plagiarism may be unintentional. However, it will still be treated as an offence. The Tutoring team can answer any plagiarism-related queries, but as a general rule, if in doubt, include attribution of all sources.

Students are encouraged to ask mentors, tutors and their peers for advice about their project work, but any submission should not include any code written by others unless it is explicitly credited to them. Failure to correctly credit code that a student hasn’t created themselves will be considered plagiarism and will result in a failing grade. Blatant or repeat offences of plagiarism will not be tolerated and will result in stringent penalties being applied, including removal from the course.
